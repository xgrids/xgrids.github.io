  To create a domain, one must exhaust its depths.
Our name, XGRIDS, comes from a famous quote by the explorer Xu Xiake: "To explore its domain, one must exhaust its secrets." Like this renowned adventurer, we are dedicated to exploring the unknown territories of the digital 3D world and discovering the infinite value it holds.
XGRIDS integrates edge computing, high-performance computing, computer graphics, 3D modeling, and other technologies to conduct years of research, innovation, and practice. We have broken through the technology of high-precision 3D real-time modeling from centimeters to kilometers and integrated software and hardware solutions to provide a comprehensive solution for the rapid generation and application of 3D content for industries such as surveying and mapping, emergency security, smart cities, gaming and tourism, intelligent manufacturing, and metaverse, achieving an upgrade in productivity and creativity.
We see the bi-directional interaction between the digital world and the real world driving humanity towards the future. XGRIDS builds a bridge between the two worlds by constructing a 3D information infrastructure that enables spatial-temporal perception, virtual-real interconnection, and free content creation.
Humanity has created magnificent civilization achievements through two-dimensional forms such as text, painting, and video. XGRIDS believes that 3D technology will uncover hidden dimensions and allow us to "return" to the 3D world in the digital realm, exploring infinite possibilities and bringing a better and more imaginative future to both the real and digital worlds, like water and electricity.
XGRIDS has a professional, inclusive and young team with nearly 50% R&D master's degree ratio from head technology and internet companies, with an average age of less than 30 years old. Here, with different industry backgrounds, we form a diverse and open professional platform to explore the infinite domain of the digital 3D world together.
